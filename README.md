# Clebsch-Gordan_Coefficients

Python script to automatically calculate CG Coefficients

Create QVector object 

---->  QVector(j1,j2)

Access j1, j2, possible m1 and m2 states, and J and M states by using their respective methods. .j1, .j2, .m1, .m2, .J, .M

Access CG table by using the .table method

Access CG table keymap by using .keymap method, this method returns a list of dictionaries with all permutations of basis transformations and their respective coefficients.
